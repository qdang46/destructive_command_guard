//! Windows disk & system-destruction pack.
//!
//! Covers the catastrophic Windows disk/system operations that are *not* plain
//! filesystem deletes (those live in `windows.filesystem`):
//!   - **Volume Shadow Copy destruction** — `vssadmin delete shadows`,
//!     `wmic shadowcopy delete`. This is the hallmark of ransomware and a common
//!     accidental data-loss vector: it destroys System Restore points and the
//!     shadow copies many backup tools rely on.
//!   - **Whole-volume / partition destruction** — `diskpart`, `Format-Volume`,
//!     `Clear-Disk`, `Remove-Partition`, `Initialize-Disk`, `Reset-PhysicalDisk`.
//!   - **Free-space wipe / boot config** — `cipher /w` (makes deleted files
//!     unrecoverable), `bcdedit /delete` (boot configuration).
//!
//! Design note: a *dedicated* `windows.system` pack is used rather than
//! extending the existing default-on-everywhere `system.disk` pack (mkfs/dd/
//! fdisk/…). That keeps these Windows-only verbs off the Unix default
//! quick-reject path (they would only ever match Windows-shaped commands) and
//! keeps all Windows packs togther with consistent `cfg(windows)` default
//! enablement. `format <drive>:` (cmd) stays in `windows.filesystem`; this pack
//! owns `Format-Volume` (PowerShell) and the lower-level disk verbs.
//!
//! All patterns are `(?i)` case-insensitive with stable rule ids
//! (e.g. `windows.system:vssadmin-delete-shadows`).
