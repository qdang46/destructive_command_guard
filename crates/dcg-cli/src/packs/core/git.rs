//! Core git patterns - protections against destructive git commands.
//!
//! This includes patterns for:
//! - Work destruction (reset --hard, checkout --, restore)
//! - History rewriting (push --force, branch -D)
//! - Stash destruction (stash drop, stash clear)
//!
//! # Effect tagging (v0.6)
//!
//! - Pack `default_effects` is `[MutateVcs, Write]` — the natural baseline
//!   for unrecognised git ops in this pack.
//! - Tier-A explicit tags are applied via [`crate::packs::effects::apply_tier_a_effects`]
//!   for ~10 high-impact rules (force push, reset --hard, clean -f, …).
